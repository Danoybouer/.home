These are my user configurations files.

I keep the hidden project directory (.home) in my home directory, move existing dot files, and symlink its content with:

$ cd && for f in $(ls -A .home/); do ln -s .home/$f ; done && rm -f ~/.git

This way I can easily manage these dot files with git between several machines.

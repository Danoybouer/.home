These are my user configurations files.
You'd usually find them in this kind of configuration:

~/
~/.bashrc -> .system/.bashrc
~/.inputrc -> .system/.inputrc
~/.system/.bashrc
~/.system/.inputrc
~/.system/.git/
~/.ssh -> ~/.system/.ssh/
~/.system/.ssh -> /media/truecrypt.ssh/

This enables quick backup or transfer between machines, as well as managing through git.

the ssh symlinks along with the 'tmssh' alias enables me to keep my ssh directory safe,
and to mount it with a quick command and key typing.
My .gitignore ignores the .ssh.tc file, refered by the 'tmssh' alias.

A small dose of paranoia never killed anyone, you know ;]

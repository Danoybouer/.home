These are my user configurations files.

To set them up:

Place the hidden project directory (.home) in your home directory
Move or rename existing dot files in your home directory
With the following command, symlink the dot files in .home with:
$ cd && for f in $(ls -A .home/); do ln -s .home/$f ; done && rm -f .git

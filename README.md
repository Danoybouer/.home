These are my user configurations files
--------------------------------------

* I store this repository in my home folder, meaning in $HOME/.home/
* I symlink the following files from $HOME:
 * .bash_profile
 * .bashrc
 * .inputrc
 * .screenrc
 * .vimencrypt
 * .vimrc

This way, all configuration files are easily version-controlled and synced between multiple machines.
